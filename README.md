The following project is the prototype version of the future project Mascara.

It is meant to keep a version control of all the changes made to the project.

Start date is 15 June 2024.

Below are the instructions:

Project Mask


The game starts when the MC is robbed from the most valuable thing they have - Love - and they must defeat multiple boss enemies to reach their goal.
The game is based on "Majora's Mask" masks system which by unlocking a mask and utilizing it would become a different character. 
Each masked character would have a designated weapon and designated special abilities. The combination of weapon and abilities has different effects. 

There are planned multiple masks based on the warriors and weapons of the Feudal Period of the 11th century. 
The combat would be skill based and tough. 
Local Multiplayer will be available through the story and with plans of implementing a versus mode.
