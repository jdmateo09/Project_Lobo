The following project is the prototype version of the future project Mascara.

It is meant to keep a version control of all the changes made to the project.

Start date is 15 June 2024.

Below are the instructions:

Project Mask

The game starts when the MC is robbed from the most valuable thing they have - Love - and they must defeat multiple boss enemies to reach their goal. Death awaits the player at the end of the journey.

The game is based on "Majora's Mask" masks system which by unlocking a mask and utilizing it would become a different character. Each masked character would have a designated weapon and designated special abilities. The combination of weapon and abilities has different effects.  It is planned to have a total of 13 masks based on the warriors and weapons of the Feudal Period of the 11th century. The artwork and concepts of each character must be exaggerated and over the top. The combat would be skill based and tough. Local Multiplayer will be available through the story and with plans of implementing a versus mode.

[  ] At first, I opted to back up and try to slow fights down from my end, but this only worked against me, as the enemies in Sekiro are just so angry. Once I decided to join in on the rhythmic fights and literally go with the flow instead of hanging back and hoping for an opening, I finally started to actually make some ground. 

[  ] Add master test - similar to Twilight Princess, an encounter that is a fight with a master. The master upon defeat will upgrade your skills.

[  ] Add healthbar, no stamina bar

[  ] Counter system with posture. There are

Counter System

The counter system is a mechanic which establishes the interaction between two characters and the posture system (Balance system)

Scenario 1 — Character A strikes Character B:

In this scenario character a strikes character b, character b will take damage to both health and posture

Scenario 2 — Character A and Character B strike collide:

Neutral interaction which results in no damage to both health and posture for both characters

Scenario 3 — Character A Strikes Character B, Character B Blocks:

Character B will take damage to posture

Scenario 4 — Character A strikes Character B, but Character B counters:

Character B counters the strike of Character A, which results in damage to the posture of Character A and an opening to strike with a quick attack (non-special attack)

Special Domain Attack/ Release Art

Every character will have an ultimate special attack; a RELEASE ART. The Release Art is a guaranteed attack that will connect to all players in the screen. The attack will have two hits, an initial hit and a final hit. Only the initial release hit can be countered. The final hit cannot be blocked, countered or dodged.

A release art can be countered by another release art. If a character A performs a release art and character B counters with a release art, then both release arts guaranteed final hit will be neutralized. However, the initial hit of the release must be parried to counter with a release art.


Attack FRAME DATA:

Idea #1
Light attack 4 frames startup - 10 frames durarion
Medium special attack 10 frames startup - 16 frames duration
Heavy special attack 20 frames startup unblockable/counter only - 26 frames duration
Dash special 4 frames invincibility start up - 10 frames duration
Dash special plus attack 4 frames invincibility startup - attack at frame 10 - duration 14 frames

Idea#2

Light Attack - 4 frames
Medium Attack - 10 frames
Dash/Dodge Attack - Invincibility Frames
Special Attack (Proyectile) - 10 frame proyectile, based on the hadouken

All attackas can be countered, except the special attack. Light Attack and Medium attack must have a frame window that allows a counter



Movement

Every character will have a dash special move. This will allow freedom of movement and expression. Character dashes will have the same invincibility frames, but different ranges.

Animations

An analysis of a slow morion video from Nobody Saves the World shows the technique they use to animate movement. It appears that the technique is to overlap different frames of animation for a smooth transition.
